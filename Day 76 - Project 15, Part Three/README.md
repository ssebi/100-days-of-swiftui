# Wrap up

- Accessibility is very important and because SwiftUI was built with accessibility in mind it is easy for developers to add extra accessibility features. Many accessibility features are already supported by default.

# 🎯 Challenges

## Challenge 1

>
The check out view in Cupcake Corner uses an image that doesn’t add anything to the UI, so find a way to make the screenreader not read it out.

## Challenge 2

>
Fix the steppers in BetterRest so that they read out useful information when the user adjusts their values.

## Challenge 3

>
Do a full accessibility review of Moonshot – what changes do you need to make so that it’s fully accessible?
