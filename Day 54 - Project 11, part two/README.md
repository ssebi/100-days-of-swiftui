# Creating books with Core Data

- We started off by creating a *Book* entity and basic UI for creating a new *Book*. 
- If we place some objects into the *environment* from a `View`, they will be available to all the views that can call it an ancestor. That means that in case of a `NavigationView`, all `Views` that are pushed to it will access a shared *environment*. In the case of `.sheet` presentation, there is no link between the `Views` so we have to explicitly set any needed `Environment` variables to the `View`.

```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showingAddScreen) {
	AddBookView().environment(\.managedObjectContext, self.moc)
}
```

# Adding a custom star rating component

- If you use a `@Binding` property that in any of your Views you'll find out that the code fail because the `Preview` need a value to be passed in. You can fix that by using a `.constant` Binding:

```swift
RatingView(rating: .constant(4))
```

# Building a list with @FetchRequest

- We've seen how easy it is to create new `Views` and compose them.
- Then we've also seen how to create a `List` that presents the fetched data coming from a `@FetchRequest`.
