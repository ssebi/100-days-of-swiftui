# Wrap up
So far we've learnt about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to create basic layout using components such as `Form`, `HStack`, `VStack`, `Sections` and `Groups`. We've also covered how to store program state using the `@State` property wrapper and we've seen some custom controls and how to use them.

# Challenges
## Challenge 1
> - Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
## Challenge 2
> - Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
## Challenge 3
> - Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.
