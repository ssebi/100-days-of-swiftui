# Bookworm: Wrap up

- In this project, we have learnt how we can use `@Binding` to share data between views, how `type erasure` can let us go around the `some View` restriction, how we can quickly persist data using `Core Data` and a few new tricks like popping `Views` inside a `NavigationLink`.

# 🎯 Challenges
## Challenge 1
>
Right now it’s possible to select no genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing a default, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose.

## Challenge 2

>
Modify ContentView so that books rated as 1 star have their name shown in red.

## Challenge 3

>
Add a new “date” attribute to the Book entity, assigning Date() to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in DetailView.
