# Wrap up

During this project, we've covered components like `DatePicker`, `Stepper`, `navigationBarItems()`, `Date` and `DateComponents`. We've also seen how we can add machine learning to our programs.

# Challenge

## Challenge 1

> Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? It’s your app – you choose!

## Challenge 2

> Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.

## Challenge 3

> Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.
