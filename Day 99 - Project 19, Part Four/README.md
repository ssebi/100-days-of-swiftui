# Wrap up

- This wasn't a particularly complicated project but it introduced us to some important techniques like `split view controllers` (or at least that's how they were called in UIKit), binding alerts to optionals and creating layout neutral layouts using `Groups`.

# 🎯 Challenges

## Challenge 1

>
Add a photo credit over the ResortView image. The data is already loaded from the JSON for this purpose, so you just need to make it look good in the UI.

## Challenge 2

>
Fill in the loading and saving methods for Favorites.

## Challenge 3

>
For a real challenge, let the user sort and filter the resorts in ContentView. For sorting use default, alphabetical, and country, and for filtering let them select country, size, or price.
