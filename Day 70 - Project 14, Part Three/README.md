# Day 70 - Bucket List, Part Three

🔗 [HWS Day 70](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/70)

# 📝 Notes

Covered topics:

- Advanced MKMapView with SwiftUI
- Customizing MKMapView annotations

# Advanced MKMapView with SwiftUI

- We've now started to put into practice what we've learnt in the first two parts by creating a `MapView` struct that uses a `Coordinator`. We've also added some code in the `updateUIView` method to add new annotations when tapping the plus button.

# Customizing MKMapView annotations

 - We've extended the existing functionality by adding two more `Bindings` and now we can add a pin, tap on it to reveal information and show an alert when tapping on the `info` button.
