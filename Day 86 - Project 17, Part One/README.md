# Flashzilla: Introduction

>
In this project we‚Äôre going to build an app that helps users learn things using flashcards ‚Äì cards with one thing written on such as ‚Äúto buy‚Äù, and another thing written on the other side, such as ‚Äúcomprar‚Äù. Of course, this is a digital app so we don‚Äôt need to worry about ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù, and can instead just make the detail for the flash card appear when it‚Äôs tapped.

# How to use gestures in SwiftUI

- Gestures are great to make fluid and interesting interfaces. We've already used the `onTapGesture`, there's also `onLongPressGesture` but for more advanced gestures we can use the gesture structs such as: `DragGesture`, `LongPressGesture`, `MagnificationGesture`, `RotationGesture` and `TapGesture`. They usually have `.onEnded` and `.onChanged` modifiers.
- When there are multiple gestures that might be recognized in the same time we can use the `.highPriorityGesture` to change which one gets recognized or use `.simultaneousGesture` to recognize them both.
- One even more advanced example is to sequence multiple gestures together to create complex use-cases such as being able to drag a view only if you long-press on it before.

# Making vibrations with UINotificationFeedbackGenerator and Core Haptics

- In UIKit haptics are very simple and they indicate success, warning or failure. Using them is as simple as this:

```swift
let generator = UINotificationFeedbackGenerator()
generator.notificationOccurred(.success)
```

- In iOS 13, Apple introduces a new framework for more advanced haptics called `Core Haptics`. Using the more advanced haptics you can customize the `intensity` and the `sharpness` of those haptics to create unique patterns.

# Disabling user interactivity with allowsHitTesting()

- SwiftUI's hit testing is pretty advanced. Setting the `allowsHitTesting(enabled:)` modifier to `false` will cause the view to refuse responding to gestures. If there are views behind, those will receive the gestures.
- The interesting part is that we can control the tap area of a view with the `.contentShape(shape:)` modifier. This can be useful for example if there's a `VStack` with some `Text` and a `Spacer` between the text. In this case tapping inside the `Spacer` won't trigger an attached tap gesture. We can fix that by adding the `.contentShape(Rectangle())` modifier. Now the whole `VStack` is tappable, even the space between the text:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Hello")
    Spacer().frame(height: 100)
    Text("World")
}
.contentShape(Rectangle())
.onTapGesture {
    print("VStack tapped!")
}
```
