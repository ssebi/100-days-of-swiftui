# Bucket List: Wrap up

- In this project we've learnt how to make custom types conform to `Comparable`, how to write data in the `Documents Directory`, we've seen how we can use `UIKit` classes in `SwiftUI` and how to communicate using `Coordinators`, how we can authenticate the user using `FaceID` and more.

# 🎯 Challenges

## Challenge 1

>
Our + button is rather hard to tap. Try moving all its modifiers to the image inside the button – what difference does it make, and can you think why?

## Challenge 2

>
Having a complex if condition in the middle of ContentView isn’t easy to read – can you rewrite it so that the MapView, Circle, and Button are part of their own view? This might take more work than you think!

## Challenge 3

>
Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication. Add code to show those errors in an alert, but be careful: you can only add one alert() modifier to each view.
