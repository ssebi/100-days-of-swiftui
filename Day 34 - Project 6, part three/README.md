# Wrap up

-  In project 6 we've seen how complex the animations system is in SwiftUI and how it can be both very easy to create animations but they can get quite wild.

# Challenges

Go back to the Guess the Flag project and add some animation:

## Challenge 1
>
When you tap the correct flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.

## Challenge 2
>
Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.

## Challenge 3
>
And if you tap on the wrong flag? Well, that’s down to you – get creative!
