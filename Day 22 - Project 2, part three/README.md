# Day 22 – Project 2: Guess the Flag, Part Three
🔗 [HWS Day 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/22)

# 📝 Notes

This is the final day of the project. So far, we've learnt about  how useful `VStacks`, `HStacks` and `VStacks` are and how we can use them to create complex layouts. We've also seen that `Colors` are views too, how to create `Gradients`, how to add images to `Buttons` and how to show `Alerts`.

# Challenges
## Challenge 1
> Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert.

## Challenge 2
> Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags.

### Challenge 3
> When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
