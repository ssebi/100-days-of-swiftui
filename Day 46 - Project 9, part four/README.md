# Wrap up

- In this project we've learnt how to draw custom `Paths` and `Shapes`, adding `strokeBorder()` support with `InsettableShape`, `drawingGroup()` to draw with `Metal`. We've also learnt how to use `CGAffineTransform`, `ImagePaint` to draw creative borders, `blend modes`, `animatableData` and `AnimatablePair`.

# 🎯 Challenge

## Challenge 1
>
Create an Arrow shape made from a rectangle and a triangle – having it point straight up is fine.

## Challenge 2
>
Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.

## Challenge 3
>
Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is the rectangular cousin of ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using a property.
