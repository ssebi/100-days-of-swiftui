If you're a begginer in SwiftUI or you just want to consolidate your learnings join me in following along with Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui

Rules are simple:
> 1. Every day you spend one hour reading or watching SwiftUI tutorials, or writing SwiftUI code.
> 2. Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!
