# Wrap up

Day 23 was a very technical but I feel now that some of the mystery of SwiftUI is gone. Although it might have been a bit overwhelming, it is definately a must read.

# Challenges

## Challenge 1
> Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.

## Challenge 2
> Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.

## Challenge 3
> Go back to project 2 and create a FlagImage() view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
