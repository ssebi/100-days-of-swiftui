# Wrap up

- This project was a little bit different that the others because now, for the first time, we've also embedded `UIKit` code and even older `CoreImage` code into `SwiftUI`. While this wasn't pretty, it sure is a necessary skill going forward. It will take some time until all `UIKit` classes will be ported into `SwiftUI`. Furthermore, we've also learnt about `ActionSheets` as a way to present more buttons than in an `Alert` and `Custom Bindings` which can be useful when we want to call custom code if a `@State` value changes.

# 🎯 Challenges

>
- Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.

>
- Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.

>
- Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
