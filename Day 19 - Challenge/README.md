ðŸ”— [HWS Day 19](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19)

## Our first challenge is the following:
> You need to build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.

> - Which units you choose are down to you, but you could choose one of these:

> - Temperature conversion: users choose Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
> - Length conversion: users choose meters, kilometers, feet, yards, or miles.
> - Time conversion: users choose seconds, minutes, hours, or days.
> - Volume conversion: users choose milliliters, liters, cups, pints, or gallons.
